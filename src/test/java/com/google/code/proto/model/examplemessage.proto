// Once this is in production:
//    don't change the tag numbers of any existing fields.
//    don't add or delete any required fields.
//    don't delete optional or repeated fields.
//    don't add new optional or repeated fields but you must use fresh tag numbers 
//       (i.e. tag numbers that were never used in this protocol buffer, not even by deleted fields).
