Demo server of Google Prootocol Buffer messages over http with and without the use of delimiters, and
java and javascript clients to read the messages over http
with and without the use of delimiters (delimiters aid message-by-message rendering).

(1) To build:
   mvn clean compile package

(2) Deploy the built webapp (which should be the directory demo/server/target/com.climbwithyourfeet.DemoGPB-server-0.1)
    to your local development appengine 
    The servlet engine is Google's appengine and is configured for that.  
    Download appengine at http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

(3) After deployment, dial http://localhost:8080/testGB.html in your browser to run the unit test.  

The unit test is testGPB.html and includes uses of the javascript clients.
The java clients can be seen in the java unit tests at
   demo/server/src/test/java/com/climbwithyourfeet/services/serveGPB
The java unit tests can be run from the project base directory with the command 'mvn test' while the
application is deployed to localhost:8080
