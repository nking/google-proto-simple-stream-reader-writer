Demo server and clients for Google Protocol Buffer messages with and without the use of
delimiters (delimiters aid message-by-message rendering).
The server streams the messages over http and the clients read them.  The clients are
java and javascript clients and the server is java.

(1) To build:
   mvn clean compile package

(2) Deploy the built webapp to your local development appengine 
    (can download appengine at http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html)
    The built webapp for this project is at demo/server/target/com.climbwithyourfeet.DemoGPB-server-0.1
    and should be deployed to the appengine servlet container
    
(3) After deployment, dial http://localhost:8080/testGB.html in your browser to run the unit test.  

The javascript unit test is testGPB.html and includes a few usages.
The java unit tests show client usage and can be seen at
   demo/server/src/test/java/com/climbwithyourfeet/services/serveGPB
The java unit tests can be run from the project base directory with the command 'mvn test' while the
application is deployed to localhost:8080
