A Java and Javascript library to read and write Google Protocol Buffer messages 
to input and output streams using delimiters between messages to aid message-by-message 
rendering.  Includes a demo project of using this within the Google appengine java web server,
streaming messages over the wire, and tests that demonstrate java and javascript clients 
that read and write the messages.

For a javascript client, you'll also need 2 files from http://github.com/sirikata/protojs
   protobuf.js
   pbj.js
